# Writeups

Some personal writeups on various topics I use as a reference. The folder
GithubMarkdown has a version of the writeups that has rendered LaTeX if
you'd like to take a peak. However, oftentimes the inline math does not
actually show up inline sometimems, so this may be harder to read. The
best way to read this is to download the html rendered with Pandoc.
