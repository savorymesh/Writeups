<h3 id="the-metric-tensor">The Metric Tensor</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a smooth manifold. A <em>Riemannian metric</em> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a symmetric, positive definite 2-tensor field <span class="math inline">\(g \in T^2(M)\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(x \in M\)</span>, on the tangent space <span class="math inline">\(T_x(M)\)</span> we have that <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> defines an inner product <span class="math inline">\(\langle X, Y \rangle = g_{|T_X}(X, Y)\)</span>. Using the inner product, notions of length and distance are defined using the usual conventions.</p>
<p>Given local coordinates <span class="math inline">\(\{x^i\}\)</span>, the metric tensor can be locally represented as <span class="math inline">\(g = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(dx^i dx^j\)</span> stands for the symmetric product of two 1-forms. The functions <span class="math inline">\(g_{ij}\)</span> are referred to as the <em>components</em> of the metric tensor <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\{x^i\}\)</span>. Put together, the components form a symmetric positive definite matrix smooth in the sense that the component functions themselves are smooth where the representation holds.</p>
<p>Through the <em>musical isomorphisms</em> <span class="math inline">\(\flat\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sharp\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> provides a canonical way of identifying the tangent space <span class="math inline">\(T_x(M)\)</span> with the corresponding dual space <span class="math inline">\({T_x^*(M)}\)</span>. Given a vector <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, we send <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to a covector <span class="math inline">\(X^\flat\)</span> by defining <span class="math display">\[X^\flat (Y) := \langle X, Y \rangle\]</span> This mapping is invertible: the inverse is, of course, <span class="math inline">\(\sharp\)</span>. We will denote the application of <span class="math inline">\(\sharp\)</span> by superscripting, as with <span class="math inline">\(\flat\)</span>.</p>
<p>The musical isomorphisms will prove to be useful tools, particularly in terms of establishing operations. For example, we will generalize the classical concept of the gradient thusly: for a smooth, real valued function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, define <span class="math display">\[\text{grad} f := df^\sharp\]</span> The musical isomorphisms also allow us to convert covariant, contravariant, or mixed tensors to tensors of other forms, operations frequently referred to as <em>raising or lowering indices</em>. When a tensor has no more than one upper or lower index, the method of applying <span class="math inline">\(\flat\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\sharp\)</span> respectively should be obvious. In ambiguous cases, however, we will explicitly describe how to apply the operation instead of adding another entry to the bestiary of notation.</p>
<h3 id="connections-and-geodesics">Connections and Geodesics</h3>
<p>We would like to consider <em>geodesics</em> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, the generalization of straight lines to a smooth manifold. Before doing so, it is necessary to establish a new type of differential operator. Let <span class="math inline">\((M, E, \pi)\)</span> be a vector bundle over <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. We will let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{E}(M)\)</span> denote the space of smooth sections of <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span>. We will represent the space of smooth vector fields over <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}(M)\)</span>. A <em>connection</em> in <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is a mapping <span class="math display">\[\nabla: \mathcal{X}(M) \times \mathcal{E}(M) \rightarrow \mathcal{E}(M)\]</span> <span class="math display">\[(X, Y) \mapsto  
\nabla_{X}{Y}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> is linear over <span class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span> in the first argument, linear over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> in the second argument, and satisfies the corresponding Leibniz rule: <span class="math display">\[
\nabla_{X}{(fY)}
 = f
\nabla_{X}{Y}
 + (Xf)Y\]</span></p>
<p>We refer to <span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{X}{(}Y)\)</span> as the covariant derivative of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in the direction of the vector field <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>An <em>affine connection</em> on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a connection where <span class="math inline">\(E = T(M)\)</span>. In the case of an affine connection, the covariant derivative provides a method of differentiating a vector field over <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> by another such vector field. The infamous <em>Christoffel symbols</em> <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_{ij}^k\)</span> are used to represent an affine connection in terms of a local frame <span class="math inline">\(\{E_i\}\)</span>, where <span class="math display">\[
\nabla_{E_i}{E_j}
 = \Gamma_{ij}^k E_k.\]</span> Collectively, the Christoffel symbols form a set of <span class="math inline">\(n^3\)</span> smooth functions where <span class="math inline">\(\{E_i\}\)</span> is defined. Using partitions of unity, one can easily show that there exists an affine connection on any smooth manifold.</p>
<p>Any affine connection gives rise to a unique connection over any other tensor bundle over <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> satisfying the following conditions</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>On <span class="math inline">\(T^0(M) = C^\infty(M), \nabla_{X}{F}  = Xf\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>On <span class="math inline">\(T(M), \nabla\)</span> is the affine connection</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{X}{(Y \otimes Z)} = ( \nabla_{X}{Y}) \otimes Z + Y \otimes (\nabla_{X}{Z})\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\nabla_{X}{(\text{tr}(Y))} = \text{tr}(\nabla_{X}{Y})\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>where tr denotes tensor contraction.</p>
<p>An affine connection also allows us to differentiate vector fields along curves. For a arbitrary smooth curve<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="math inline">\(\gamma: I \to M\)</span> where we allow for <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> to be possibly closed or unbounded, a vector field along <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is a smooth map <span class="math inline">\(V: I \to T(M)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(V(t) \in T_{\gamma(t)}(M)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(t \in I\)</span>. We will denote the space of vector fields along <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}(\gamma)\)</span>. For any smooth curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, the affine connection <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> induces a mapping <span class="math display">\[D_\text{t}
: \mathcal{X}(\gamma) \to \mathcal{X}(\gamma)\]</span> fulfilling the following conditions</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(D_\text{t}\)</span> is linear over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(D_\text{t} (fV) = \dot{f}V + f D_\text{t} V\)</span></li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{V}\)</span> is a vector field on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{V}|_{\gamma}\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(D_\text{t} V(t) = \nabla_{\dot{\gamma}(t)}{\tilde{V}}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Using local coordinates, the map is given by <span class="math display">\[D_\text{t}
V(t_0) = \big( \dot{V}^k(t_0) + V^j(t_0)\dot{\gamma}^i(t_0) \Gamma_{ij}^k (\gamma(t_0))\big)\partial_k\]</span> For a vector field <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> along a curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, we refer to <span class="math inline">\(D_\text{t} V\)</span> as the covariant derivative of <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> along <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>.</p>
<p>Having constructed the machinery of covariant differentation of vector field along curves, we are now able to generalize ‘straight lines’ to our manifold in a straightforward manner. We define the <em>acceleration of a curve</em> <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> to be <span class="math inline">\(D_\text{t} \dot{\gamma}\)</span>. A <em>geodesic</em>, then, is a curve with acceleration identically equal to zero, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(D_\text{t} (\dot{\gamma}) \equiv 0\)</span>. For any <span class="math inline">\(x \in M\)</span>, any <span class="math inline">\(V \in T_p(M)\)</span>, and any <span class="math inline">\(t_0 \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, there exists an open interval <span class="math inline">\(I_{t_0}\)</span> around <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> and a geodesic <span class="math inline">\(\gamma : I_{t_0} \to M\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma (t_0) = x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\dot{\gamma} (t_0) = V\)</span>. Furthermore, if <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\gamma}\)</span> are two geodesics satisfying the aforementioned conditions, then they agree on their mutual domain. This guarantee of uniqueness allows for the realization of a unique <em>maximal geodesic</em>: given <span class="math inline">\(x \in M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V \in T_x(M)\)</span>, there exists a geodesic <span class="math inline">\(\gamma^\prime : I_{t_0}^\prime \to M\)</span> where the domain <span class="math inline">\(I_{t_0}^\prime\)</span> is maximal in the sense that it cannot be extended to any larger open interval.</p>
<p>Note that the geodesics on a smooth manifold depend on the choice of affine connection. On a Riemannian manifold, there exists a nearly canonical choice. Before giving this connection a proper introduction, we first introduce the <em>torsion tensor</em> of a connection, a vector-valued two-form: <span class="math display">\[\tau : \mathcal{X}(M) \times \mathcal{X}(M) \to \mathcal{X}(M)\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\tau(X,Y) :=  \nabla_{X}{Y} -  \nabla_{Y}{X} - [X, Y]\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\([\cdot, \cdot]\)</span> is the usual Lie bracket. Using the canonical isomorphism between multilinear maps from <span class="math inline">\(T_x(M) \times T_x(M) \to T_x(M)\)</span> to the space of <span class="math inline">\(2 \choose 1\)</span>-tensors on <span class="math inline">\(T_x(M)\)</span>, we also view <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> as a <span class="math inline">\(2 \choose 1\)</span>-tensor field. If the torsion tensor associated to a connection <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> is identically equal to zero, we say that <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> is <em>symmetric</em> or <em>torsion-free</em>.</p>
<p>Next, we introduce the property of compatibility with a metric. Given a Riemannian manifold <span class="math inline">\((M, g)\)</span> with affine connection, <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> we say that <span class="math inline">\(\nabla\)</span> is <em>compatible with the metric</em> <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> if for all <span class="math inline">\(X, Y, Z \in \mathcal{X}(M)\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\nabla_{X}{g(Y,Z)}
 = g(
\nabla_{X}{Y}
,Z) + g(Y,  
\nabla_{X}{Z}
)\]</span></p>
<p>Our favored connection, the <em>Levi-Civita connection</em>, is a unique connection that exists on any Riemannian manifold which is both symmetric and compatible with the metric. Henceforth, we will always assume the given affine connection is the Levi-Civita connection when stated without further qualifications.</p>
<p>Given a geodesic <span class="math inline">\(\gamma : I \to M\)</span> in a Riemannian manifold, we will define the speed of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(|\dot{\gamma}(t)|\)</span>. It is satisfying to know that under the Levi-Civita connection, all geodesics are of constant speed.</p>
<h3 id="the-exponential-map">The Exponential Map</h3>
<p>The <em>Riemannian exponential map</em>, exp, is an object of critical importance in Riemannian geometry. Intuitively, the exponential map generalizes nothing less than the action in an Euclidean space of moving a single unit in a direction! Given <span class="math inline">\(x \in M\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V \in T_x(M)\)</span>, let <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_V\)</span> be the unique maximal geodesic associated to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\({\Upsilon} = \{V \in T(M)\)</span>: the domain of <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_V\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span>}, an open subset of <span class="math inline">\(T(M)\)</span>. Define</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{exp} : {\Upsilon} \to M\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\text{exp}(V) := \gamma_V(1)\]</span></p>
<p>Briefly, we will list some key properties of the exponential map.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The Riemannian exponential map is smooth.</p></li>
<li><p>We have that <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_V(t) = \text{exp}(tV)\)</span> where either side of the equality exists.</p></li>
<li><p>For any <span class="math inline">\(x \in M\)</span>, there exists an neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> around <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and a neighborhood <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{U}\)</span> around the origin in <span class="math inline">\(T_x(M)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\text{exp}_{|\tilde{U}}\)</span> maps diffeomorphically onto <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>One final piece of terminology in this section: if every maximal geodesic on a Riemannian manifold <span class="math inline">\((M, g)\)</span> is defined for all <span class="math inline">\(t \in \mathbb{R}\)</span>, or, equivalently, the domain of the exponential map <span class="math inline">\(\Upsilon\)</span> is the entire tangent bundle <span class="math inline">\(T(M)\)</span>, we say that the manifold is <em>geodesically complete</em> or simply <em>complete</em>.</p>
<h3 id="lengths-and-geodesic-distance">Lengths and Geodesic Distance</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> be an interval (possibly unbounded) with endpoints <span class="math inline">\(a, b,\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; b\)</span>. For a smooth curve <span class="math inline">\(\gamma : I \to M\)</span>, define the <em>length of the curve</em> <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> by <span class="math display">\[\mathcal{L}(\gamma) = \int_a^b |\dot{\gamma}(t)|dt.\]</span> If <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is bounded and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> can be extended to a curve on cl<span class="math inline">\((I)\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}(\gamma)\)</span> is finite. Note that so long as <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is not a trivial curve, we can always reparametrize <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> to be a unit-speed curve without changing its length.</p>
<p>A <em>curve segment</em> will be a curve whose domain is a closed, bounded interval <span class="math inline">\([a, b]\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> is a curve segment where <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(a) = x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma(b) = y\)</span>, then we will say <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> <em>connects</em> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. We now have enough machinery to define the <em>geodesic distance</em> <span class="math inline">\(d(x,y)\)</span> between two points on a Riemannian manifold <span class="math inline">\((M, g)\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[\label{gdist}
d(x,y) := \underset{\gamma}{\inf} \ \mathcal{L}(\gamma)\]</span> where we consider the infimum over all curve segments connecting <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. It may very well be that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> are not connected by any curve segment: in that case we use the convention that the infimum returns a value of <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\gamma}\)</span> is a curve segment such that the infimum is attained on <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\gamma}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\gamma}\)</span> has a unit-speed parametrization, we say <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\gamma}\)</span> is a <em>minimizing geodesic</em>. Naturally, <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\gamma}\)</span> turns out to be a geodesic in the sense that <span class="math inline">\(D_\text{t} \tilde{\gamma} \equiv 0\)</span> as well.</p>
<p>Remarkably, the geodesic distance forms a metric<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> on a Riemannian manifold, where we are flexible with our definition of a metric in allowing the metric to take the value <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>. Moreover, the topology <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> induces on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> agrees with the original manifold topology of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is a connected (and therefore path-connected) Riemannian manifold, <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is a finite metric.</p>
<p>From here on out, we will restrict ourselves to the setting of connected Riemannian manifolds. Here, the famed Hopf-Rinow theorem reveals motivation for using the term ‘geodesically complete’. We state its conclusions without proof.</p>
<hr />
<h6 id="hopf-rinow">Hopf-Rinow:</h6>
<p>On a connected Riemannian manifold <span class="math inline">\((M, g)\)</span>, the following statements are equivalent:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is complete as a metric space under the geodesic distance function <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\((M, g)\)</span> is geodesically complete.</p></li>
<li><p>The closed and bounded subsets of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> are compact (Heine-Borel Property).</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>If <span class="math inline">\((M, g)\)</span> is a complete Riemannian manifold, for any <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in M\)</span>, there is always a minimizing geodesic <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\gamma}\)</span> that connects <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. We assert that a compact Riemannian manifold is always complete.</p>
<h3 id="more-on-geodesic-distance-and-the-cut-locus">More on Geodesic Distance and the Cut Locus</h3>
<p>The material in this section will be more advanced and less generally well known than the previous material. To guarantee the veracity of our results, all manifolds mentioned in this section will be assumed to be complete and connected<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. For our problem at hand, we would like to study the distance between a source point and all other points in the Riemannian manifold. Additionally, we will also want to consider the distance between a compact subset of a manifold to the remaining points. Let us then define <span class="math display">\[\phi_y(x) := d(x, y)\]</span> and <span class="math display">\[\phi_K(x) := \underset{y \in K}{\inf} d(x,y)\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is a compact subset of <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. These are the main objects of consideration in this thesis. We will find it proves useful to recognize that for <span class="math inline">\(x \in M\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x \notin K\)</span>, there exists a (not necessarily unique) geodesic <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\gamma}\)</span> such that the distance from <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is minimized with <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{\gamma}\)</span>; just take a sequence of elements <span class="math inline">\(\{y_n\} \in K\)</span> converging to the minimum distance, observe that <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is compact and closed so that a subsequence must converge to another element <span class="math inline">\(y \in K\)</span>, and remember that there is always a minimizing geodesic connecting any two points in a complete Riemannian manifold. This leads us to the following propositions:</p>
<hr />
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> be a compact subset of a Riemannian manifold <span class="math inline">\((M, g)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_K\)</span> the distance function to the subset <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\phi_K\)</span> is smooth at <span class="math inline">\(x \in M\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> satisfies the Eikonal equation <span class="math display">\[|\text{grad} \ \phi_K| = 1\]</span> and there is a unique minimizing geodesic from <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Let <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> be a point in a Riemannian manifold <span class="math inline">\((M, g)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_y\)</span> the distance function to the point <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. For all points for <span class="math inline">\(x \in (M, g)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x \neq y\)</span> for which there are unique minimizing geodesics connecting <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\phi_y\)</span> is smooth at x.</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Given a source point <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, we will let <span class="math inline">\(Cut_o(y)\)</span> denote the <em>ordinary cut locus of</em> <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Elements of <span class="math inline">\(Cut_o(y)\)</span> are the set of points in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> for which there are multiple minimizing geodesics connecting them to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Away from <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> itself and <span class="math inline">\(Cut_o(y)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\phi_y\)</span> must be smooth.</p>
<p>To see how <span class="math inline">\(\phi_y\)</span> can fail to be smooth at <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> itself and <span class="math inline">\(Cut_o(y)\)</span>, let us consider a simple example. Let <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> be two antipodal points on the sphere <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(x \in Cut_o(y)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\phi_y\)</span> is respectively maximized and minimized at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. However, <span class="math inline">\(\phi_y\)</span> must also satisfy the Eikonal equation where <span class="math inline">\(\phi_y\)</span> is smooth, and thus, if <span class="math inline">\(\phi_y\)</span> were smooth at <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, the gradient could not have vanished at those points, a contradiction. Thus, elements in the ordinary cut locus may function as critical points, causing the failure for the distance function to be smooth.</p>
<p>Some geometers like to deal with the squared distance function <span class="math inline">\(\phi_x^2\)</span> rather than <span class="math inline">\(\phi_x\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\phi_x^2\)</span> will be smooth at the source point <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. There exists an enlightening result that a complete, connected Riemannian manifold <span class="math inline">\((M,g)\)</span> of dimension <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> must be diffeomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> if there exists <span class="math inline">\(z \in M\)</span> such that the squared distance function <span class="math inline">\(\phi_z^2\)</span> is everywhere smooth. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> forms a special case in that the associated distance functions are especially well-behaved.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\((M, g)\)</span> be a Riemannian manifold of dimension <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(B(M)\)</span> denote the Borel sets on <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>, i.e. the smallest <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra containing the collection of open sets in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. We will say a set <span class="math inline">\(S \subseteq M\)</span> is measurable if for any chart <span class="math inline">\((U, \rho)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\rho(S \cap U)\)</span> is Lebesgue measurable. We will let <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda(M)\)</span> denote the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra of all measurable sets in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>. Clearly, <span class="math inline">\(B(M) \subseteq \Lambda(M)\)</span>.</p>
<p>There is a canonical measure <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> defined on <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda(M)\)</span>, which we will unceremoniously name the <em>Riemannian measure</em>. The measure <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span> can be constructed using the defining property that for any measurable set in a chart <span class="math inline">\((U, \rho)\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\nu(S) = \int_{\rho (S)} \sqrt{\text{det }g}d\lambda\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> denotes the Lebesque measure, and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is the Riemannian metric.</p>
<p>The existence of the Riemannian measure makes it straightforward to consider integration on Riemannian manifolds. We will immediately use this to define a divergence operator. Let <span class="math inline">\(C^\infty_0(M)\)</span> denote the subspace of <span class="math inline">\(C^\infty(M)\)</span> consisting of functions with compact support. Then we will define the divergence <span class="math display">\[\text{div} : \mathcal{X}(M) \to C^\infty(M)\]</span> by setting div <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to be the unique smooth function such that for all <span class="math inline">\(u \in C^\infty_0(M)\)</span> the following identity holds <span class="math display">\[\int_{M} (\text{div } X) u \ d\nu = \int_{M} \langle X, \text{ grad } u
\rangle \ d\nu\]</span></p>
<p>In local coordinates, one can obtain using integration by parts that <span class="math display">\[\text{div } X = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\text{det }g}} \  \partial_i \
({\sqrt{\text{det }g} \ X^i)}\]</span></p>
<p>As we have a gradient and divergence, it is now simple to generalize a version of a Laplacian to our Riemannian manifold. We define the <em>Laplace-Beltrami operator</em> as <span class="math display">\[\Delta: C^\infty(M) \to C^\infty(M)\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\Delta := \text{div} \circ \text{grad }\]</span></p>
<p>In local coordinates, this becomes <span class="math display">\[\Delta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\text{det }g}} \  \partial_i \  ({\sqrt{\text{det }g}
\ g^{ij} \ \partial_j)}\]</span></p>
<h3 id="heat-kernels-and-varadhans-formula">Heat Kernels and Varadhan’s Formula</h3>
<p>Given a connected Riemannian manifold <span class="math inline">\((M, g)\)</span>, the heat kernel on <span class="math inline">\((M, g)\)</span> is a mapping <span class="math inline">\(K(t, x, y)\)</span> where <span class="math display">\[K : (0, \infty) \times (M, g) \times (M, g)  \to
\mathbb{R}\]</span> that is the smallest positive <em>fundamental solution</em> to the heat equation posed on <span class="math inline">\((0, \infty) \times (M, g)\)</span>. By a fundamental solution we mean that <span class="math inline">\(K(t, x, y)\)</span> satisfies</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{d}{dt} K= \Delta_x K \\\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[K(t, \cdot, y) \to \delta_y(x) \text{ as } t \to 0\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\Delta_x\)</span> is used to denote that we let the Laplacian act on the second variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\delta_y(x)\)</span> is a Dirac delta distribution centered at <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. We say <span class="math inline">\(K(t, x, y)\)</span> is smallest in the sense that if <span class="math inline">\(N(t, x, y)\)</span> is another positive fundamental solution, <span class="math inline">\(K(t, x, y) \leq N(t, x, y)\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\((0, \infty) \times (M, g) \times (M, g)\)</span>. The existence of the heat kernel on the entire manifold <span class="math inline">\((M, g)\)</span> can be shown by considering the limit of similarly motivated heat kernels on an exhausting sequence of precompact sets with smooth boundary.</p>
<p>In the simple setting of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>, the heat kernel can be given by the explicitly as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[K(t, x, y) = (4\pi t)^{-n/2} \text{exp}\left( {-\frac{1}{4t} |x - y|^2}\right).\]</span></p>
<p>where exp is the standard exponential function on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. We can apply a simple transformation and see immediately that <span class="math display">\[-4 t \text{ log } K(t, x, y) \to |x - y|^2 \text{ as } t \to 0\]</span> The function <span class="math inline">\(|x - y|^2\)</span> is the squared distance function on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span>. This behavior actually holds in the setting of all complete, connected Riemannian manifolds with bounded distance functions:</p>

<h6 id="varadhans-formula">Varadhan’s Formula:</h6>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\((M, g)\)</span> be a complete, connected Riemannian manifold whose distance function <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is bounded. Let <span class="math inline">\(K(t, x, y)\)</span> be the associated heat kernel. Then <span class="math display">\[-4 t \text{ log } K(t, x, y) \to d(x,y)^2 \text{ as } t \to 0.\]</span></p>
